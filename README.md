# LLM LangChain & LangGraph Practice and Some RAG

## Project Overview
This project focuses on practicing various LLM (Large Language Model)-related tasks using LangChain and LangGraph, while also learning the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique.

## Directory Structure
- `prac/`: Directory containing practice code and notebook files.
- `faiss_index/` and `faiss_index_jupyter/`: Directories where FAISS index files are stored.
- `requirements_mac.txt` and `lang_requirements.txt`: Files defining the Python package requirements for running the project.

## Key Practice Topics
1. **Using Hugging Face**: Basic usage of LLMs with the Hugging Face library.
2. **Getting Started with LangChain**: Overview and basic usage of LangChain.
3. **Output Parser**: Methods for parsing model outputs.
4. **Prompt Memory**: Utilizing prompt memory effectively.
5. **Introduction to RAG**: Basic concepts of Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
6. **Introduction to LangGraph**: Graph-based workflows using LangGraph.
7. **Agents**: Automating tasks with LangChain agents.

## Environment Setup(recommend)
It is recommended to set up the virtual environment locally using `uv` and the `lang_requirements.txt` file.
